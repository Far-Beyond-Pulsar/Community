# Pulsar Engine Community Policy

## Purpose

The Pulsar Engine community exists to build a high‑performance, experimental game engine in the open. This policy defines the shared expectations that allow contributors, users, and organizations to collaborate productively and without fear of judgment or gatekeeping.

This document is not meant to be legalistic or exhaustive. It exists to clearly state our values, boundaries, and goals so that everyone understands what kind of community Pulsar aims to be.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open to Everyone

Pulsar is open source for everyone.

Individuals, hobbyists, students, researchers, startups, and large corporations are all welcome to:

* Use Pulsar for any purpose, including commercial and for‑profit products
* Study and modify the source code
* Contribute improvements back to the project

There are no moral, ideological, or industry‑based restrictions on usage beyond the project’s license.

---

### 2. Judgment‑Free Collaboration

We value curiosity, experimentation, and learning.

* New contributors are welcome
* Questions are welcome
* Incomplete ideas are welcome
* Bugs are expected

Critique code, designs, and ideas — **not people**. Assume good faith and focus on making the software better.

---

### 3. Experimental by Design

Pulsar is early‑stage and evolving.

You should expect:

* Rough edges
* Breaking changes
* Incomplete or abandoned features
* Performance experiments that may not work out

This is intentional. Stability will improve over time, but experimentation comes first.

---

### 4. Commercial Use Is Valid

Using Pulsar to make money is not against our values.

Commercial and corporate usage is explicitly allowed and encouraged. Real‑world production use helps validate the engine and exposes issues that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Organizations that benefit from Pulsar are **encouraged but never required** to give back through:

* Code contributions
* Bug reports and performance data
* Documentation improvements
* Financial sponsorship or infrastructure support

Access to the project is never conditional on donation or contribution.

---

### 5. No Gatekeeping

We do not discriminate based on:

* Experience level
* Employment status
* Company size
* Profit motive
* Background or identity

If you follow the license and respect the community, you belong here.

---

## Expected Conduct

All participants are expected to:

* Be respectful and professional
* Communicate clearly and constructively
* Accept feedback in good faith
* Respect differing viewpoints and priorities

Harassment, personal attacks, intimidation, or exclusionary behavior are not tolerated.

Disagreements are normal; hostility is not.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

Contributions of all kinds are valued:

* Code
* Documentation
* Issue reports
* Performance benchmarks
* Design discussions

There is no requirement to contribute in order to use Pulsar.

Maintainers reserve the right to:

* Decline contributions that do not align with the project’s direction
* Request changes for clarity, safety, or maintainability
* Prioritize long‑term health of the engine over short‑term gains

These decisions are about project stewardship, not personal judgment.

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding this policy.

If behavior violates the spirit or letter of this document, maintainers may:

* Ask for changes in behavior
* Moderate discussions
* Remove content or contributions
* Restrict participation in extreme cases

Enforcement decisions are made to protect the health of the community and project.

---

## Closing

Pulsar Engine is built *with* the community, not just *for* it.

We aim to create a space where ambitious ideas, serious engineering, and respectful collaboration coexist. If that resonates with you, we’re glad you’re here.
